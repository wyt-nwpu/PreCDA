Bioinformatics analysis predicted that hsa_circ_0043256 could work as a miR-1252 sponge, which could in turn directly target a vital negative regulator of Canonical Wnt signaling, Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH), as validated by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot results further confirmed that hsa_circ_0043256 could upregulate ITCH expression, whereas miR-1252 could partially abolish this effect. Interestingly, hsa_circ_0043256 knock-down could weaken Wnt/¦Â-catenin pathway inhibition induced by CA. Finally, we discovered that CA induced apoptosis and meanwhile upregulated hsa_circ_0043256 expression in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ITCH expression was positively association with hsa_circ_0043256 levels."	2017/11/1	28958934

Although hsa_circ_0020397 did not influence miR-138 expression per se, hsa_circ_0020397 did inhibit miR-138 activity, as examined via the expression of miR-138 targets telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Hsa_circ_0020397 promoted cell viability and invasion of CRC cells and inhibited their apoptosis, whereas miR-138 had the opposite effect. Nevertheless, hsa_circ_0020397 antagonized miR-138 suppression of cell growth. When TERT or PD-L1 expression was suppressed with siRNAs, the above functions of hsa_circ_0020397 were attenuated, suggesting that hsa_circ_0020397 can regulate CRC cell viability, apoptosis and invasion by promoting the expression of miR-138 target genes."	2017/9/1	28707774
