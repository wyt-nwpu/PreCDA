We validated their expression levels via qRT-PCR in 20 sets of PDAC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. We found that the expression patterns of seven circRNAs were consistent with the microarray data.
345	Hsa_circ_0001649: A circular RNA and potential novel biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma	Cancer Biomark.	2016	26600397	hsa_circ_0001649	-		hepatocellular carcinoma	qRT-PCR	human	down-regulated	miR-1283, miR-4310, miR-182-3p, miR-888-3p, miR-4502, miR-6811-5p, miR-6511b-5p, miR-1972	SHPRH	tissue and cell line	Hsa_circ_0001649 was significantly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our findings indicate hsa_circ_0001649 might serve as a novel potential biomarker for HCC and may function in tumorigenesis and metastasis of HCC.

347	cir-ITCH Plays an Inhibitory Role in Colorectal Cancer by Regulating the Wnt/beta-Catenin Pathway	PLoS One	2015 Jun 25	26110611	-	circITCH		colorectal cancer	qRT-PCR	human	down-regulated	miR-7, miR-20a, and miR-214	ITCH	tissue and cell line	Cir-ITCH expression was typically down-regulated in CRC compared to the peritumoral tissue. This result, as well as several follow-up experi- ments, showed that cir-ITCH could increase the level of ITCH, which is involved in the inhibi- tion of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

349	Circular RNA ITCH has inhibitory effect on ESCC by suppressing the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway	Oncotarget	2015 Mar 20	25749389	-	circ-ITCH		esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	qRT-PCR	human	down-regulated	miR-7, miR-17, miR-214, ITCH	ITCH	tissue and cell line, PDX	ITCH hyper expression promotes ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated Dvl2, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. These results indicate that cir-ITCH may have an inhibitory effect on ESCC by regulating the Wnt pathway.
